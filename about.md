<a href='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/portfolio-screeshots/Michael+Do%27s+Resume.pdf'>My Resume</a>

<p>
  Hi! I am Michael Do. I've been coding since August 2014, but I'm always learning. Currently, I am enrolled in the Bloc.io program, but I graduate in October! I do my best work with Ruby on Rails, but I've finished a few Codecademy courses, such as Javascrip, CSS, and Javascript. <br /><br />

  When I'm not coding, I'm usually working full-time at a Vietnamese restaraunt. I spend my free time either hanging with friends, watching movies, or reading comic books. If you like Marvel or DC, then I would LOVE to talk about them. Anyone interested in a deeper conversation can drop me an email.

This app is designed for designers. It tracks and records 'events' that have happened in any of my other apps that I created. By events, I mean, how many times a page is loaded, or how often a button gets clicked. These events are then put onto a pie chart and also a line chart.
Again, I am terrible at artistic design, so I left that part alone, but the functionality of the site works exactly as it's supposed to.

Summary
This was a very simple project, and I believe the less words, the better. One of my first projects with minimal guidance.  This app is a to-do list where the items delete themselves after having not been completed for 7 days.

Explanation
So this was a very simple project, designed to get me started working on my own. The core of what was asked of me was very easy and I finished quickly.

Problem
I ran into a few problems regarding AJAX, such as trying to get list items to disappear and reappear.

Solution
I had a mentor that walked me through it, and showed me how AJAX worked.

Results
I am very proud of the what resulted from my work. A functional task list with decent design. There were more features I wanted to add, such as having a timer next to each item, or a fucnction that would reorder the list, but all the apps out there now from the GooglePlay store and Apple Store really makes my app obsolete.

Conclusion

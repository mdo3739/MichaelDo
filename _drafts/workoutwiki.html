This app was designed to be a public wiki where anyone could sign up and add, edit, or delete public posts. My heart wasn't really in this one because I didn't believe in the usefulness of it. I simply built the core functionality that was asked of me and stopped. The parts that could use some work are the design, the concept, and the organization of it's structure.  Through building this site, I learned how to use the gem "Stripe" and charge for extra services for the site.

This is a site where people with a passion for a healthy life through exercise could post their own personal work-outs, including the do's and don'ts of some well known exercises, too.
